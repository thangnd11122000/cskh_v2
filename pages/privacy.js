              Access to selected features of the Service may be provided to you
              free of charge. We will charge fees for certain features, either
              on a one-time or a subscription basis (&ldquo;Paid

              fees or change the fees for certain services at any time by
              providing you notice on the Service or otherwise. When you
              purchase any Paid Services, you authorize Red Bow Limited or its
              third party payment processors to charge the credit card
              identified by you (which you represent and warrant that you are
              authorized to use) all applicable fees for your purchase,
              including all applicable taxes, and you agree that our payment
              provider can store your credit card information. If Red Bow

              your responsibility. Red Bow Limited does not refund automatic
              payments not cancelled in time.
